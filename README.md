# Benchmarks
## AIMD and MLFF-AIMD benchmarks for CH3NH3PbI3 thermalization runs.

CH3NH3PbI3; all tests on dardel

System size: 384 atoms (perfect cell), 381 atoms (one Pb+2 vacancy, 2 I- vacancies, even electrons) 

- Equilibration is achieved in ~800fs (looking at velocity autocorrelation function), T = 300. K
- Goal: match g(r) after equilibration for perfect cell. <img src="./perfect_cell.jpeg" alt="Perfect cell" width="100" />
- Limitation: AIMD for MAPbI3 seems to be memory intensive

MLFF - AIMD - 1000 steps (1fs each):
   1. 128 cores
   Walltime: 2.3585 hours
   2. 196 cores
   Walltime: 1.4380 hours
   3. 256 cores
   Walltime: 1.1643 hours

- Diffusion events: need ~10 ps at the least for halide ions, more for cation diffusion
