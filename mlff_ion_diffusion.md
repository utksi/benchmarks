CH3NH3PbI3; all tests on dardel

System size: 384 atoms (perfect cell), 381 atoms (one Pb+2 vacancy, 2 I- vacancies, even electrons) 

- Equilibration is achieved in ~800fs (looking at velocity autocorrelation function)
- Goal: match g(r)
- Limitation: AIMD for MAPbI3 seems to be memory intensive
- Diffusion events, need ~10 ps at the least for halides, more for cation diffusion
